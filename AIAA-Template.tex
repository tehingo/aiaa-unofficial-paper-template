%
% Compiling:
%  - Recommendation: make sure the files are encoded as UTF8
%  - Use pdflatex for compiling,
%    bibtex for bibliography, makeindex for nomenclature
%  - Note: If you know what you are doing, preferably use lualatex as compiler
%    and uncomment the relevant packages in Preamble.tex. For questions, contact
%    the author.
%
% To execute AIAA old-school nomenclature run:
%  - makeindex -s nomencl.ist -o AIAA-Template.gls AIAA-Template.glo
%
% General note:
%  - Original AIAA template is *very* out-dated. Updated with recent packages
%  - .PDF upload is allowed for conferences, so no problem there

%% AIAA style guidelines
%%  - Taken from file 'author_guide.pdf', part of aiaa-3.6.tar.gz
%%  - See: ~/Original files, AIAA Template v3.6.1/releases/aiaa-3.6.tar.gz

% Notations (see author_guide.pdf)
% --------------------------------
% Use "figure", "table" (small, written out)
% Table caption on top, figure below
% For citations, use Ref.~1 (inconsistent with above, but oh well...)
% For equations, use Eq.~1 (again, inconsistent...... well well well.)
% At beginning of sentence write out, e.g., Equation~1, Reference~1
% Express ranges with "to", eg. Eqs.~1 to~3.
% Put "periods and commas in quotation marks," but "exclamations not"!
% Use listings as this, that, and that (serial comma)
% If number of authors >= 6, say et al. in bibliography
% Label for sub floats: a), b), etc.
% For figure axes, use words

% Remarks on style (see author_guide.pdf)
% ---------------------------------------
% Use micrometer, not micron
% Graph within a graph is an inset, not insert
% Use alternatively, not alternately (unless something alternates)
% Whereas instead of while (unless referring to simultaneous events)
% Do not use essentially to mean approximately or effectively
% Do not use issue for euphemism of problem
% Data is plural, e.g., "data are" not "data is"
% Join prefixes such as non, sub, micro, multi, ultra with word, "submillimeter"
% Do not italicize i.e., e.g.
% Acknowledgment (without e after g, US style)

\section{Introduction}

\lettrine{T}{\textsc{his}} is how you work with the file. Add lettrines to
beginnings of sections. Units work like this \SI{13.3}{km}, unit-less numbers
like this \num{12991.91241} or this \num{1.098118e-8}, and angles like this
\ang{1.781}. Put citations only after dots or commas, like
this.\cite{wirin:90cp}


\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

This should get you started. When using in-line citations use
Ref.~\citen{wirin:90cp}. Note that the tilde $\sim$ is used as protected
space.
