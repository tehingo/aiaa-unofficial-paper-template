  Abstract                 = {The problem of controller design for flexible spacecraft is addressed. Model-based compensators, which rely on the knowledge of the system parameters to tune the state estimator, are considered. The instability mechanisms resulting from high sensitivity to parameter uncertainties are investigated. Dissipative controllers, which use collocated actuators and sensors, are also considered, and the robustness properties of constant-gain dissipative controllers in the presence of unmodeled elastic-mode dynamics, sensor/actuator nonlinearities, and actuator dynamics are summarized. In order to improve the performance without sacrificing robustness, a class of dissipative dynamic compensators is proposed and is shown to retain robust stability in the presence of second-order actuator dynamics if acceleration feedback is employed. A class of dissipative dynamic controllers is proposed which consists of a low-authority, constant-gain controller and a high-authority dynamic compensator. A procedure for designing an optimal dissipative dynamic compensator is given which minimizes a quadratic performance criterion. Such compensators offer the promise of better performance while still retaining robust stability.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of minimal fuel thrust programming for the terminal phase of a lunar soft landing mission is shown to be equivalent to the minimal time problem for the mission. The existence of an optimal (minimal fuel) thrust program for the problem is then assured by appealing to existence theorems for time optimal controls, and the optimal thrust program is developed by application of the Pontryagin maximum principle. It is shown that the optimal thrust program consists of either full thrust from the initiation of the mission until touchdown, or a period of zero thrust (free-fall) followed by full thrust until touchdown. An approximate switching function which is adequate for a large number of cases is derived, and a preliminary system design is presented.},
