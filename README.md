# Unofficial updated AIAA paper template

## About the template:
The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) provides a 
LaTeX template for the conference and journal papers on [its website](https://www.aiaa.org/secondary.aspx?id=4597). Unfortuntaely, this template still loads long outdated
packages, that are now obsolete—it was last updated in 2004.
For detailed info on the changes of this updated template, see 'Preamble.tex' of this bundle.

This template is an attempt at providing an updated version of the original
AIAA template. The class file remains unchanged, so your resulting file will still
comply to the AIAA requirements.


## How you will benefit from this template:
* You will be able to compile the template with recent TeX distributions
* You will encounter less bugs
* The document will look prettier
* Ultimately, it should give you less of a headache


## Planned features:
The LaTeX community can be slow to adapt to advances. Once the following major pacakges
have found main-stream application, they will be incorporated into the template:
* [biblatex](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) (successor to bitex)
* [glossaries](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/glossaries) (newer than nomenclature)
* [fontspec](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fontspec) and [unicode-math](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/unicode-math) (unicode font typesetting with XeLaTex and LuaLaTeX)
* [selnolig](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/selnolig) (ligature supression)
* …and possibly more
